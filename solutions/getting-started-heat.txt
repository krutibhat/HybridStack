getting started with HEAT - 

below are the few commands to execute:


nova secgroup-add-rule default icmp -1 -1 0.0.0.0/0
nova secgroup-add-rule default tcp 22 22 0.0.0.0/0
glance image-create --name=F17-x86_64-cfntools --disk-format=qcow2 --container-format=bare < files/F17-x86_64-cfntools.qcow2
glance image-create --name=F17-i386-cfntools --disk-format=qcow2 --container-format=bare < files/F17-i386-cfntools.qcow2
nova keypair-add --pub_key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub admin_key
ssh-keygen -f "/home/pavan/.ssh/known_hosts" -R 10.0.0.2

heat create stackname --template-file=/opt/stack/heat/templates/AutoScaleSampleAZ.template --parameters="InstanceType=m1.large;DBUsername=wp;DBPassword=verybadpassword;KeyName=heat_key;LinuxDistribution=F17"

wait for like 20 - 30 mins for the loadbalancer instance to get initialized..
It will spawn the first wordpress instance.. 

After waiting for a few minutes, this instance will also become initialized..

in the first wordpress instance,

sudo yum install gcc
sudo yum install make
sudo yum wget http://weather.ou.edu/~apw/projects/stress/stress-1.0.4.tar.gz
./configure && make && sudo make install

Execute or give load by the stress command:

If there's enough memory left, you should see a successfully new instance being spawned ...
Or it will go to a error state.


Note: You have to make few code modifications accordingly and make it work..
It had to increase the timout period to a larger value and recompile the HEAT.
