Nova Architecture Basics
OpenStack is a collection of open source technologies delivering a massively scalable cloud operating system.

What should it provide ?
  1.)Users to register/manage cloud instances
	2.)Custom images of OS
	3.)Configure and operate cloud infrastructure

4 kinds of users
	1.)developers
	2.)devops (leads etc)
	3.)owners (Consumer) 
	4.)operators(Admin)

Broad overview of NOVA architecture
http://c204396.r96.cf1.rackcdn.com/nova-cactus-logical.gif

Two main Varieties
1.)WSGI applications to receive and mediate API calls (nova-api, glance-api, etc.) 
	You can call these as WEB ROLES
2.)Worker daemons to carry out orchestration tasks (nova-compute, nova-network, nova-schedule, etc.)
	You can call these as WORKER ROLES

NOVA-API
nova-api is like a cloud controller all the API request come to nova-api first.We can use either Open Stack APIS or Amazon EC2 APIs(Just the apis not the service) to communicate with the nova-api.

NOVA-SCHEDULE
Decides which instances could be run(From the queue of request) based on available resources.It also decide on which end host it will run.
This is a pluggable architecture so we can write our own scheduler.
(I feel this is one of the place where we should look into deeper)

NOVA-COMPUTE
Creates and terminates instances.
This is the one which launches the instance(KVM instance for example).

NOVA-VOLUME
Allows attaching and detaching of persistent storage(Like Amazons Elastic Block Storage). It can use variety of providers like iSCSI or AoE

NOVA-NETWORK(Quantum Now)
Accepts networking tasks from the Queue works similar to nova-compute and volume(:P)

QUEUE
Central hub for message passing .
(Recommended to tryout simple message passing using Rabbitmq to understand it better)

HORIZON
The openstack Dashboard is built using django.

GLANCE
	1.)GLANCE-API - Accepts APi calls this like a recieving window all the request pass through this
	2.)GLANCE-REGSTRY - metadata about the images present 
	3.)IMAGE-STORE - image blobs are stored here
